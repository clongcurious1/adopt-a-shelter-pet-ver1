# adopt-a-shelter-pet-ver1
This Beginner-Level Python project walks a user through the process of adopting a shelter pet, including initial research, personal preferences, and resources. These variables are plugged into a brief matching game at the end of the program, matching the user's pet preferences to a dictionary of available shelter pets.
