# adopt-a-shelter-pet-ver1
This Python project walks a user through the process of adopting a shelter pet, including initial research, personal resources (money, time, living and outdoor space, etc.), and personal preferences. These variables are used again at the end of the program to match the user's pet preferences against a dictionary of available shelter pets. 

This project was created to meet specifications to pass my first Python course in Code Louisville (Fall 2021).
