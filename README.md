# adopt-a-shelter-pet-ver1
This Python project walks a user through the process of adopting a shelter pet, including initial research, personal resources (money, time, living and outdoor space, etc.), and personal preferences. These variables are used again at the end of the program to match the user's pet preferences against a dictionary of available shelter pets. 

This project was created to meet specifications to pass my first Python course in Code Louisville (Fall 2021).

This is VERSION ONE of the project - created merely to meet specifications in the course. In this version, the program runs in the terminal. The program is based on the user looking for a shelter DOG (there is no option to choose a different shelter pet).

VERSION TWO might include option to choose either a DOG or a CAT - allowing different coding tracks based on that choice. Version Two might also be presented inside an interactive Jupyter notebook.
